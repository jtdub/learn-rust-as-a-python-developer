# Learn Rust as a Python Developer

A fast-track guide to learning Rust for experienced Python developers. Built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Set up the docs environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material

# Serve locally
mkdocs serve
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

## What's Inside

- **12 chapters** that map Python concepts to their Rust equivalents
- **4 hands-on projects** of increasing complexity
- Side-by-side Python/Rust code comparisons throughout

## Projects

| Project | Skills Practiced |
|---------|-----------------|
| CLI Calculator | Variables, types, functions, match |
| Word Frequency Counter | Ownership, collections, file I/O, error handling |
| TODO App | Structs, enums, modules, serde, file persistence |
| GitHub Stats CLI | Async HTTP, clap, serde, traits, concurrency |

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (for mkdocs)
- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) (for building the projects)
