# Rust for Python Developers

Welcome! You're about to discover how Rust complements your Python expertise.

## What's Inside

This guide transforms your Python knowledge into Rust proficiency through:

* **Mental Model Translation** - See how Python concepts map to Rust idioms
* **Real-World Projects** - Five complete applications you'll actually use
* **Performance Insights** - Understand when and why to choose Rust
* **Gradual Complexity** - Build understanding step by step

## Your Learning Journey

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
Understand the Rust mindset and set up your workflow. You'll learn why Rust makes different design choices than Python and how to leverage both languages together.

### Phase 2: Core Language (Weeks 3-4)
Master variables, types, and control structures. Discover how compile-time guarantees change your development approach.

### Phase 3: Memory Mastery (Weeks 5-6)
This is where Rust truly differs. Learn ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes - concepts that enable zero-cost safety.

### Phase 4: Build Mode (Weeks 7-10)
Apply your knowledge through five progressively complex projects that mirror real-world scenarios.

## Who Benefits Most

This guide works best if you:

- Write Python professionally or as a serious hobby
- Want performance without sacrificing correctness
- Need to distribute compiled executables
- Are curious about systems-level programming
- Seek better concurrent code capabilities

## The Rust Advantage

### Speed Without Compromise
Rust delivers C-like performance while preventing entire categories of bugs at compile time.

### Zero-Cost Abstractions
Write elegant, high-level code that compiles to optimal machine instructions.

### Fearless Concurrency
The compiler ensures thread safety, eliminating data races before your code runs.

### Ecosystem Growing Fast
Modern tooling, active community, and increasing adoption in production systems.

## What Makes This Guide Different

### Python-First Perspective
Every concept starts with "What you know in Python" before introducing the Rust equivalent.

### Hands-On Focus
You'll build a recipe manager, log analyzer, weather client, task queue, and data transformer - tools you can actually use.

### Honest Trade-offs
We discuss when Python is still the better choice and when Rust shines.

## Navigation Tips

- **Beginner**: Follow sequentially from "The Python-Rust Bridge"
- **Experienced**: Jump to specific topics using the sidebar
- **Project-Driven**: Skip to "Build Projects" after reading Foundation
- **Reference**: Use "Quick Lookup" for syntax translations

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] 1+ years of Python experience
- [ ] Comfort with terminal/command line
- [ ] Basic understanding of functions and classes
- [ ] Willingness to think differently about memory

## Getting Started
